# Allegro Reviews
**Allegro Reviews** is a sentiment analysis dataset, consisting of 11,588 product reviews written in Polish and extracted from [Allegro.pl](https://allegro.pl) - a popular e-commerce marketplace. Each review contains at least 50 words and has a rating on a scale from one (negative review) to five (positive review).

We recommend using the provided train/dev/test split. The ratings for the test set reviews are kept hidden. You can evaluate your model using the online evaluation tool available on [klejbenchmark.com](https://klejbenchmark.com/).

The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://klejbenchmark.com/static/data/klej_ar.zip).

## Evaluation
To counter slight class imbalance in the dataset, we propose to evaluate models using wMAE, i.e.macro-average of the mean absolute error per class. Additionally, we transform the rating to be between zero and one and report 1 âˆ’ wMAE to obtain the final score.

Python implementation of the proposed metric:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error


def ar_score(y_true, y_pred):
    ds = pd.DataFrame({
        'y_true': (y_true - 1.0)/4.0, 
        'y_pred': (y_pred - 1.0)/4.0,
    })
    wmae = ds \
        .groupby('y_true') \
        .apply(lambda df: mean_absolute_error(df['y_true'], df['y_pred'])) \
        .mean()

    return 1 - wmae
```
